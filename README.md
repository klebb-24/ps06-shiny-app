#Link to shinyapp: https://klebb24.shinyapps.io/ps06-shinyapp/
#This assignment includes the use of functions such as strong, renderText, renderTable, filter, 
#ggplot, p, ncol, nrow, and many others to build a shinyapp link that displays data on Railroad 
#Accident and Incidents. Under the Weather and Visibility Panel, the side bars have widgets that let
#you adjust the bar chart graphs based on weather type, and also can allow you to see when the accident occured.
#The final panel displays a sample of the entire dataset. It is just a sample since the entire dataset is 
#too large to be displayed on one page.
